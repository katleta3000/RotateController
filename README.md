# RotateController
An extension for UINavigationController that can make 3D rotate animation on push and pop action

Usage is simple - just add extension file to your project and use new behaviour:
`self.navigationController!.pushViewController(controller, rotateDirection: .Left)`

You can see the result of such UIViewController transition in Sample.gif or on the image below:
